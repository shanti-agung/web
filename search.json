    "section": "",
    "text": "Every year, RLadies Philly organizes a datathon to promote learning among R enthusiasts and contribute to the local community. In 2021, the organization partnered with JAT, a coalition of organizations with a shared mission of holding judicial candidates accountable to a vision of justice that aligns with the community’s vision.\nThe data was information on Philadelphia public court docket between 2010 to 2020. Teams explored the data from three different emphasis: team 1 focused on creating data visualization, team 2 defined and quantified judge “harshness,” and team 3 aimed to understand systemic trends in the courts.\nI joined team 2, where we examined judge harshness using a modeling approach. We quantified “harshness” as days of confinement that a judge sentenced. Then, we built random coefficient models and dummy variable models on a dataset of 176,712 dockets and 186 judges. After considering offense grades, defendant demographic information, and court information, our preliminary findings suggest that some judges are “harsher” than others. The models also offer estimates of average days of confinement that a particular judge may sentence. As the results were preliminary, further work is needed to examine judge harshness.\nThe code and the report exploring judge harshness in Philadelphia courts are available in the GitHub repo of RLadies Philly-JAT Datathon.\nI had a great time, met wonderful data enthusiasts, and learned much by participating in the JAT Datathon. I am genuinely grateful to RLadies Philly and JAT for hosting this fantastic event."

    "title": "Research Study on MPS Program for Quality Education",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Early in the visit, I started a collaboration with Masyarakat Pendidikan Sejati (MPS) —an Indonesian non-profit organization with a vision of “transforming education into an effective means to live a meaningful life.” Together with the MPS founder, we initiated an evaluation study on their teacher-training program titled “Transformation Program: A Virtue and Character Strengths Driven Approach to Quality Education.”\nMPS (then Yayasan Sasana Daya Cipta) initiated the Transformation Program in 1993 in Jawa Barat province in Indonesia. While the program initially emphasized creativity and individual learning, it currently focuses on school community transformation. Then in 2012, MPS introduced the program in Sumba Timur district in Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) province. NTT, where 20 percent of the people live in poverty (BPS Data Kemiskinan dan Ketimpangan, 2012), is an underdeveloped province in Indonesia.\nTo identify potential contributions of evaluating the Transformation Program, I reviewed economic literature on education in developing countries. The review focused on formal education, school ages (i.e., life-cycle stage 2 (Behrman, 2010)), and factors inside education systems (e.g., Glewwe & Kremer (2006)).\nStudies examining how education systems in developing countries affect the quality of education have approached the low level of educational outcomes as an education production function problem or agency problem. In contrast, we view this problem as a problem of identity beliefs.\nWe grounded our view on theoretical models of identity beliefs, particularly those developed by Akerlof & Kranton (2000) and Bénabou & Tirole (2011). Besides the literature review, we conducted qualitative groundwork through field visits to the Sumba Timur district. I also developed a preliminary design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of the Transformation Program.\nConducting an impact evaluation on the Transformation Program could benefit the ongoing effort to achieve quality education in developing countries by providing empirical evidence on an alternative view of accountability, an internal rather than external accountability. In so doing, such a study will also provide a basis for organizations and policy-makers to consider whether to include intervention in teachers’ identity beliefs into their existing approaches to improving teachers’ efforts and students’ learning outcomes. A reproduction of the presentation slides is available here.\nI am grateful to Pak Raka and Pak Nana of MPS and Pak Asep of SMERU Research Institute for making the project and research visit possible; to teachers and school principles for their time and insights; and to fellow researchers at SMERU Research Institute for the great conversations, helpful feedback, and altogether awesome time during my visit at the institute.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAkerlof, G.

    "text": "The project focused on assessing sampling calculators. The deliverable was a sample-size-calculator decision tool for 1,500 Save the Children staff members who work on data collection to choose suitable calculators for their type of study.\nStarting in August 2021, our team evaluated sampling calculators often used by Save the Children staff members. We clarified the underlying assumptions of those calculators, specified possible limitations, and verified their calculations for sample size and level of accuracy. The resulting tool is publicly available at Save the Children’s Resource Center.\nThis project was a joy to work on. I sincerely thank Statistics Without Borders, Save the Children, Sangeeta – our project PM, Rick – our statistical expert consultant, and my fellow reviewer volunteers – Abraham, Casey, and Shalini, for making this valuable project a wonderful experience. It was an honor to be part of the team."
