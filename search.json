    "section": "",
    "text": "The data was information on Philadelphia public court docket between 2010 to 2020. Teams explored the data from three different emphasis: team 1 focused on creating data visualization, team 2 defined and quantified judge “harshness,” and team 3 aimed to understand systemic trends in the courts.\nI joined team 2, where we examined judge harshness using a modeling approach. We quantified “harshness” as days of confinement that a judge sentenced. Then, we built random coefficient models and dummy variable models on a dataset of 176,712 dockets and 186 judges. After considering offense grades, defendant demographic information, and court information, our preliminary findings suggest that some judges are “harsher” than others. The models also offer estimates of average days of confinement that a particular judge may sentence. As the results were preliminary, further work is needed to examine judge harshness.\nThe code and the report exploring judge harshness in Philadelphia courts are available in the GitHub repo of RLadies Philly-JAT Datathon.\nI had a great time, met wonderful data enthusiasts, and learned much by participating in the JAT Datathon. I am genuinely grateful to RLadies Philly and JAT for hosting this fantastic event. In the project listing, the photo for this post is courtesy of Unsplash."

    "title": "Research Study on MPS Program for Quality Education",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The Transformation Program\nMPS (then Yayasan Sasana Daya Cipta) initiated the Transformation Program in 1993 in Jawa Barat province in Indonesia. While the program initially emphasized creativity and individual learning, it currently focuses on school community transformation. Then in 2012, MPS introduced the program in Sumba Timur district in Nusa Tenggara Timur (NTT) province. NTT, where 20 percent of the people live in poverty (BPS Data Kemiskinan dan Ketimpangan, 2012), is an underdeveloped province in Indonesia.\n\n\n\n\nPotential contributions\nTo identify potential contributions of evaluating the Transformation Program, I reviewed economic literature on education in developing countries. The review focused on formal education, school ages (i.e., life-cycle stage 2 (Behrman, 2010)), and factors inside education systems (e.g., Glewwe & Kremer (2006)).\nStudies examining how education systems in developing countries affect the quality of education have approached the low level of educational outcomes as an education production function problem or agency problem. In contrast, we view this problem as a problem of identity beliefs.\nWe grounded our view on theoretical models of identity beliefs, particularly those developed by Akerlof & Kranton (2000) and Bénabou & Tirole (2011). Besides the literature review, we conducted qualitative groundwork through field visits to the Sumba Timur district. I also developed a preliminary design of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the impact of the Transformation Program.\nConducting an impact evaluation on the Transformation Program could benefit the ongoing effort to achieve quality education in developing countries by providing empirical evidence on an alternative view of accountability, an internal rather than external accountability. In so doing, such a study will also provide a basis for organizations and policy-makers to consider whether to include intervention in teachers’ identity beliefs into their existing approaches to improving teachers’ efforts and students’ learning outcomes. A reproduction of the presentation slides is available here.\n\n\nI am grateful to Pak Raka and Pak Nana of MPS and Pak Asep of SMERU Research Institute for making the project and research visit possible; to teachers and school principles for their time and insights; and to fellow researchers at SMERU Research Institute for the great conversations, helpful feedback, and altogether awesome time during my visit at the institute.

    "text": "The project focused on assessing sampling calculators. The deliverable was a sample-size-calculator decision tool for 1,500 Save the Children staff members who work on data collection to choose suitable calculators for their type of study.\nStarting in August 2021, our team evaluated sampling calculators often used by Save the Children staff members. We clarified the underlying assumptions of those calculators, specified possible limitations, and verified their calculations for sample size and level of accuracy. The resulting tool is publicly available at Save the Children’s Resource Centre.\nThis project was a joy to work on. I sincerely thank Statistics Without Borders, Save the Children, Sangeeta – our PM, Rick – our statistical expert consultant, and my fellow reviewer volunteers – Abraham, Casey, and Shalini, for making this valuable project a wonderful experience. It was an honor to be part of the team. In the project listing, the photo for this post is courtesy of Unsplash."

    "title": "Interpreting Models of Wellbeing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In my paiR program organized by RLadies Amsterdam, my learning partner and I chose interpretable machine learning as our topic. We decided to study together the first edition of the Interpretable Machine Learning book by Christoph Molnar, followed by an individual project applying concepts and tools explained in Molnar (2021).\n\n\n\nAbout the Interpretable ML book\nThe book focuses on making supervised learning interpretable. In a nutshell, Molnar suggested three ways of making machine learning interpretable. One is using machine learning models that, by design, reveal their internal mechanisms. These models are also called white models or interpretable models. The yellow branch in the mind map below shows interpretable models.\n\n\n\nBased on https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/\n\n\nAnother approach is to use model-agnostic interpretable methods, shown by the orange branch of the mind map. If we have a black box, this orange branch approach is akin to a set of X-ray tools that help us look inside the black box.\nThe third approach is to select a few instances to explain the behavior of the machine-learning models. For that reason, this approach is known as the example-based approach, shown in the red branch. This red branch, like the orange branch, is model agnostic.\nThree things to like about this book:\n\nIt helps us understand the nuance of interpretability. It turns out that interpretability is not a plain-vanilla concept. Early in the book, Molnar dedicated a chapter discussing the various point of view on interpretability.\nIt offers guidance on when to use a particular interpretability method. For that purpose, Molnar elaborated on the advantages and disadvantages of each interpretability method.\nIt includes implementation tips. For each interpretability method, Molnar informed readers what package to use, both in R and in python. He also provided concrete examples with source codes available on using ilm, an interpretability package in R that he developed.\n\n\n\n\n\nApplying methods for interpretable ML\nThe Authentic Happiness Project collected the data via an online survey and made the dataset available on Kaggle. This dataset contains 15,977 survey responses. I used the dataset’s ‘flow’ experience and stress level variables to assess well-being.\nIn psychology, ‘flow’ is defined as a mental state when a person is totally immersed in an activity that s/he is doing (Csikszentmihalyi, 1997). The person then experiences a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment in the process of this activity. Experiencing flow is one way to achieve well-being (Tse et al., 2021). In contrast, experiencing stress may dampen well-being. A higher level of perceived stress is associated with lower well-being (Hepburn et al., 2021).\nI trained a regression model using the hours of flow a person experiences in a week as an outcome variable. Additionally, I trained a classification model to predict whether a person would be in the high-stress or low-stress category.\nInsights from applying interpretability tools include:\n\n\n\n\n\nA Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) shows that the more weekly meditation hours, the lower the probability that a person would be in a high-stress category. However, when weekly meditation reaches 7.5 hours per week, additional hours of meditation do not lower the probability further.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Accumulated Local Effect (ALE) plot shows that the number of lost vacation days in a year is associated with higher predicted being in the high-stress category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Surrogate (LIME) explanations for two instances in the dataset show that little time for passion and few remarkable achievements that he was proud of have a negative effect on the hours of flow experience in a week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA figure shows Shapley values for a survey response, in this example, the 100th response. With a predicted 3.41 hours of flow experience, this response is 0.25 hours higher than the average prediction of 3.16 hours. No time for passion had the largest negative contribution. Social networks and the number of daily steps had a positive contribution.\n\n\nI sincerely thank R-Ladies Amsterdam —especially Janine and Melissa, for organizing my paiR program; Ada —my learning partner, for the stimulating discussions; and Christoph Molnar for writing the book on interpretable machine learning and making it accessible.
