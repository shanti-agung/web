Statistic Without Borders launched a project in partnership with Save the Children.

This consultation project focused on assessing sampling calculators, culminating in a sample-size-calculator decision tool for 1,500 Save the Children staff members who work on data collection to choose suitable calculators for their type of study.

In evaluating sampling calculators, we clarified their assumptions, specified possible limitations, and verified their calculations for sample size and level of accuracy. The resulting tool is publicly available at [Save the Children's Resource Center](https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/document/sample-size-calculator-decision-tool/).

This project was a joy to work on. I sincerely thank Statistics Without Borders, Save the Children, Sangeeta -- our project PM, Rick -- our statistical expert consultant, and my fellow reviewer volunteers -- Abraham, Casey, and Shalini, for making this valuable project a wonderful experience. It was an honor to be part of the team.
