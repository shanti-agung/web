Statistic Without Borders launched a consultation project to help Save the Children.

The project focused on assessing sampling calculators. The deliverable was a sample-size-calculator decision tool for 1,500 Save the Children staff members who work on data collection to choose suitable calculators for their type of study.

Starting in August 2021, our team evaluated sampling calculators often used by Save the Children staff members. We clarified the underlying assumptions of those calculators, specified possible limitations, and verified their calculations for sample size and level of accuracy. The resulting tool is publicly available at [Save the Children's Resource Centre](https://resourcecentre.savethechildren.net/document/sample-size-calculator-decision-tool/).

This project was a joy to work on. I sincerely thank Statistics Without Borders, Save the Children, Sangeeta -- our PM, Rick -- our statistical expert consultant, and my fellow reviewer volunteers -- Abraham, Casey, and Shalini, for making this valuable project a wonderful experience. It was an honor to be part of the team. In the project listing, the photo for this post is courtesy of Unsplash.
